# Nummerical differentiation using Python
Nummerical differentiation using Python. This script allows you to calculate the nummerical derivative of a (1+2)D (1 time coordinate, 2 spatial) dataset. The original data is captured using a high-speed camera, around 300 fps. The data shows the time and spatial coordinates of the center of mass of an ordinary pendulum. 

I compare the nummerical derivative to the analytical derivative, using least square differences method. I apply some smoothing techniques along the way.
